    <p>Meet Blum. That's pronounced like "Bloom" and is short for Jeff Goldblum. She is a Russian Blue cat.</p>
    <p>Blum is very kind. She is usually very mild-mannered but she likes to yell when she gets hungry. She is a little over 1.5 years old and has lived in Grand Rapids, MI her whole life. She'll move down to Houston to be with me right after Thanksgiving and I'm excited to have her with me. She will also be getting a little brother at around that time.</p>
